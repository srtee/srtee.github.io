> Research Software Engineers are people who combine professional software expertise with an understanding of research. [^1]

I drifted slowly into becoming an RSE via my work on [constant potential molecular dynamics](/projects/CPMMD_project), as I learned how to write code in C++ (the hard way!).
My day job requires me to achieve academic goals, such as publishing papers and applying for grants -- not just for my own progress but to account to the taxpayers who pay my wages!
But RSE work lives in a different space -- especially working on open source software, where someone has to maintain code (and communities!) without relying on commercialization for a living.

So I am curious about different ways of understanding and recognizing just what, exactly, I do, and how I add value to the research community.
Maybe it's hard to quantify what I do precisely because it's actually not worth that much!
But more likely it's hard to quantify what I do because it provides a diffuse benefit to many people, like so much activity in the open source ecosystem.
I am learning more everyday about this [third space](https://mdap.unimelb.edu.au/2020/09/17/defining-the-third-space/) that I inhabit and how I can grow to help more people do more things better.
Watch this space!
