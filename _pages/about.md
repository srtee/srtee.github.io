I am a physicist and coder who specializes in all molecular dynamics simulations weird and unusual. I currently focus on developing new theoretical methods in [constant potential molecular dynamics](/projects/constant-potential-molecular-dynamics/) and [nonequilibrium molecular dynamics](/projects/nonequilibrium-molecular-dynamics/), together with implementations in [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org) using C++.

I am also a passionate [Research Software Engineer](https://researchsoftware.org). Current academic pathways provide little recognition or progression for the work RSEs, like myself, put into developing open source software and making it accessible to the wider research community. I hope to somehow help to change that! I've joined the [RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand](https://rse-aunz.github.io) and I'm keeping an eye out for opportunities to contribute.

When I'm not at work I am kept busy by two young children, an air fryer, and a growing assortment of obsolete devices which I will someday transform back into something useful. I regularly answer questions about molecular dynamics at the [MatSci forums](https://matsci.org/c/lammps/40) and [Matter Modeling on StackExchange](https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com). I am a Christian scientist (not a Christian Scientist!) and I regularly worship at [City Chapel, Kenmore](https://www.citychapel.com.au/).
